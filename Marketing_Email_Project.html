        <h2>What am I learning right now?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="technology"><img src="https://iili.io/6wD6p1.png" alt="HTML Icon"><span class="vertical">&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML5</span><br>
            <span class="technology_description">I've mastered the basics - tables, forms, inserting multimedia and links. Right now I'm mainly focusing on learning how to make my sites more responsive and how to get the most out of the combination of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript - which I've recently started to discover.</span>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li class="technology"><img src="https://iili.io/6wDrYB.png" alt="CSS Icon"><span class="vertical">&nbsp;&nbsp;CSS</span><br>
            <span class="technology_description">I only recently started studying CSS and discovering what can be done with it. The more I've learned, the more I understand how much I have left to learn. I try to immediately apply all knowledge in practice on projects like this.</span>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li class="technology"><img src="https://iili.io/6wD4kP.png" alt="JavaScript Icon"><span class="vertical">&nbsp;&nbsp;JavaScript</span><br>
            <span class="technology_description">I won't deny it - I'm still new to JavaScript. What can be achieved with it fascinates me, but I know that I still have a long way to go.</span>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li class="technology"><img src="https://iili.io/6wDg2V.png" alt="C# Icon"><span class="vertical">&nbsp;&nbsp;C#</span><br>
            <span class="technology_description">I'm really enjoying learning C# even though I'm just getting started with it. The syntax of the language and the overall complexity convinced me that this is the language I would like to work with in the future.</span>
